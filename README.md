  ## Description
  The purpose of creating a README-Generator through the command line in the terminal is to make the process of creating a README for repos more efficient. Upon opening the terminal, users answer a series of questions, and once complete, the README document will be dynamically created along with the responses appended to it, placed in their appropriate sections.
