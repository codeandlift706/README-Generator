  ## Description
  The purpose of creating a README-Generator through the command line in the terminal is to make the process of creating a README for repos more efficient. Upon opening the terminal, users answer a series of questions, and once complete, the README document will be dynamically created along with the responses appended to it, placed in their appropriate sections.

  ## Installation
  VS Code for JavaScript. GibHub for version control and for this repo. The npm inquirer@8.2.4 also needs to be installed. The link can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4.

  ## Usage
  This can be used when users need to create a README for GitHub repos.

  ## Tests
  To test this README generator, make sure that the appropriate installations have been completed. Users can then clone this repo, navigate to the terminal of this directory, and test typing "node index" in the terminal command line. Answer the series of questions with "test" and select a license at random. Upon answering all questions, a new README file will be created in your VS code of the repo, or, if you have an existing README file, what the user inputted will overwrite what was on the README file previously. Please see a screenshot of an example below:
